# DATA ANALYSIS 
<p>Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision- making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.</p>
<p>Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on statistical modelling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information. In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses on the application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.</p>
<p> Data integration is a precursor to data analysis, and data analysis is closely linked to data visualization and data dissemination.
</p>
<h2> THE PROCESS OF DATA ANALYSIS </h2>
<p> Analysis, refers to dividing a whole into its separate components for individual examination. Data analysis, is a process for obtaining raw data, and subsequently converting it into information useful for decision-making by users. Data, is collected and analyzed to answer questions, test hypotheses, or disprove theories. </p>
<p> Statistician John Tukey, defined data analysis in 1961, as: </p>
<p> "Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data." </p>
<p> There are several phases that can be distinguished, described below. The phases are iterative, in that feedback from later phases may result in additional work in earlier phases.The CRISP framework, used in data mining, has similar steps. </p>

<h3> Data requirements </h3>
<p>The data are necessary as inputs to the analysis, which is specified based upon the requirements of those directing the analysis or customers (who will use the finished product of the analysis). The general type of entity upon which the data will be collected is referred to as an experimental unit (e.g., a person or population of people). Specific variables regarding a population (e.g., age and income) may be specified and obtained. Data may be numerical or categorical (i.e., a text label for numbers). </p>
<hr>
<h3> Data collection </h3>
<p> Data are collected from a variety of sources. The requirements may be communicated by analysts to custodians of the data; such as, Information Technology personnel within an organization. The data may also be collected from sensors in the environment, including traffic cameras, satellites, recording devices, etc. It may also be obtained through interviews, downloads from online sources, or reading documentation. </p>
<hr>
<h3> Data processing <h3>
<p> Data, when initially obtained, must be processed or organized for analysis. For instance, these may involve placing data into rows and columns in a table format (known as structured data) for further analysis, often through the use of spreadsheet or statistical software. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Data cleaning </h3>
<p>Once processed and organized, the data may be incomplete, contain duplicates, or contain errors. The need for data cleaning, will arise from problems in the way that the datum are entered and stored. Data cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors. Common tasks include record matching, identifying inaccuracy of data, overall quality of existing data, deduplication, and column segmentation.Such data problems can also be identified through a variety of analytical techniques. For example, with financial information, the totals for particular variables may be compared against separately published numbers, that are believed to be reliable.Unusual amounts, above or below predetermined thresholds, may also be reviewed. There are several types of data cleaning, that are dependent upon the type of data in the set; this could be phone numbers, email addresses, employers, or other values. Quantitative data methods for outlier detection, can be used to get rid of data that appears to have a higher likelihood of being input incorrectly. Textual data spell checkers, can be used to lessen the amount of mis-typed words, however, it is harder to tell if the words themselves are correct. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Exploratory data analysis </h3>
<p> Once the datasets are cleaned, it can then be analyzed. Analysts may apply a variety of techniques, referred to as exploratory data analysis, to begin understanding the messages contained within the obtained data. The process of data exploration may result in additional data cleaning or additional requests for data; thus, the initialization of the iterative phases mentioned in the lead paragraph of this section. Descriptive statistics, such as, the average or median, can be generated to aid in understanding the data. Data visualization is also a technique used, in which the analyst is able to examine the data in a graphical format in order to obtain additional insights, regarding the messages within the data. </p>
<hr>
<h3> Modeling and algorithms </h3>
<p> Mathematical formulas or models (known as algorithms), may be applied to the data in order to identify relationships among the variables; for example, using correlation or causation. In general terms, models may be developed to evaluate a specific variable based on other variable(s) contained within the dataset, with some residual error depending on the implemented model's accuracy (e.g., Data = Model + Error). </p>
<p> Inferential statistics, includes utilizing techniques that measure the relationships between particular variables. For example, regression analysis may be used to model whether a change in advertising (independent variable X), provides an explanation for the variation in sales (dependent variable Y). In mathematical terms, Y (sales) is a function of X (advertising). It may be described as (Y = aX + b + error), where the model is designed such that (a) and (b) minimize the error when the model predicts Y for a given range of values of X. Analysts may also attempt to build models that are descriptive of the data, in an aim to simplify analysis and communicate results. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Data product </h3>
<p>A data product, is a computer application that takes data inputs and generates outputs, feeding them back into the environment. It may be based on a model or algorithm. For instance, an application that analyzes data about customer purchase history, and uses the results to recommend other purchases the customer might enjoy.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Communication </h3>
<p>Once the data are analyzed, it may be reported in many formats to the users of the analysis to support their requirements. The users may have feedback, which results in additional analysis. As such, much of the analytical cycle is iterative.</p>
<p>When determining how to communicate the results, the analyst may consider implementing a variety of data visualization techniques, to help clearly and efficiently communicate the message to the audience. Data visualization uses information displays (graphics such as, tables and charts) to help communicate key messages contained in the data. Tables are a valuable tool by enabling the ability of a user to query and focus on specific numbers; while charts (e.g., bar charts or line charts), may help explain the quantitative messages contained in the data.</p>

<h2> PROJECT ON PREDICTIVE MODELLING IN DATA ANALYSIS </h2>

<h3>Title of the Project : ‘Car Price Predictor’ </h3>

<p> <b>The Problem : </b>The prices of new cars in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. So, customers buying a new car can be assured of the money they invest to be worthy. But due to the increased price of new cars and the incapability of customers to buy new cars due to the lack of funds, used cars sales are on a global increase (Pal, Arora and Palakurthy, 2018). There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features. Even though there are websites that offers this service, their prediction method may not be the best. Besides, different models and systems may contribute on predicting power for a used car’s actual market value. It is important to know their actual market value while both buying and selling. </p>
<hr>
<p><b>The Client : </b> To be able to predict used cars market value can help both buyers and sellers. </p>
<p> <u>Used car sellers (dealers): </u>They are one of the biggest target group that can be interested in results of this study. If used car sellers better understand what makes a car desirable, what the important features are for a used car, then they may consider this knowledge and offer a better service. </p>
<p><u>Online pricing services: </u> There are websites that offers an estimate value of a car. They may have a good prediction model. However, having a second model may help them to give a better prediction to their users. Therefore, the model developed in this study may help online web services that tells a used car’s market value. </p>
<p><u>Individuals:</u> There are lots of individuals who are interested in the used car market at some points in their life because they wanted to sell their car or buy a used car. In this process, it’s a big corner to pay too much or sell less then it’s market value. </p>
<hr>
<p> 
<b> The Dataset : </b>The dataset used in this project is an open dataset, by Jeffrey C. Schlimmer.
This dataset is in CSV format, which separates each of the values with commas, making it
very easy to import in most tools or applications. It is hosted on IBM’s free cloud Storage. </p>
<p>
The <u>first attribute : "symboling" </u>, corresponds to the insurance risk level of a car.
Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with their price.
Then, if an automobile is more risky, this symbol is adjusted by moving it up the scale.
A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.
</p>
<p>
The <u> second attribute : "normalized-losses" </u> is the relative average loss payment per insured
vehicle year.This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door
small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per
car per year.The values range from 65 to 256. </p>
<p>The other attributes are easy to understand.The 26th attribute is “price". This is our target value, or label, in other words. This means "price" is the value that we want to predict from the dataset, and the predictors should be all the other variables listed, like "symboling", “normalized-losses", "make" and so on. </p>
<p> Thus, <b> <u> the goal of this project is to predict "price" in terms of other car features. </b> </u> </p>
